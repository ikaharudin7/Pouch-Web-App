# Proyek-TI
IT Project 

To run the code, open two terminals, within the server and front folders, and then run 'npm start'. 
The website functionality will only work when both the server and front end are running.

Here are the steps to run the project.

1. Open the repository on VSCode, and then open up 2 separate terminals

2. On one terminal, direct to the 'front' folder with 'cd front'

3. On the other, direct to the 'server' folder with 'cd server'

4. Run 'npm start' on both terminals and localhost:3030/ should pop up in a browser.
